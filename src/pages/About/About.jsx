                            This is a system wherein a separate tower or building is dedicated (in most cases) for parking
                            spaces. It can accommodate 80 to 120 cars and can be designed to meet any type of car requirements,
                            making it suitable for hatchbacks, SUVs, sedans and MUVs. This system can also be installed within
                            the project building itself.

                            Car parking tower system mainly comprises of vertical columns, a lift for vertical movement of
                            vehicles, and pallets for horizontal movement. As the car enters the building space through the
                            entrance room, it is then raised onto the parking space through the main lift and then moved into
                            empty space using pallet movement. It is completely hassle free as itâ€™s an automated system with no
                            human intervention, making it much safer.
